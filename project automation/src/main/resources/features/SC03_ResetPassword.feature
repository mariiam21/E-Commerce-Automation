@resetpass
Feature: User could successfully reset their password.
***Note**** in this case you just need to confirm that this message is displayed "Email with instructions has been sent to you."
In the event that the user had a properly registered account, navigated to the home page, clicked on "log in," and then selected "forgot password," could the user successfully reset the password?
Additionally, the user must enter a valid email address and click the Recover option.
The user should then see a notification at the top that reads, "Email with instructions has been sent"
